## "Hello World", I'm Christopher ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at 42Heilbronn with a focus on C and C++. 
- I value clean, structured code.
- I enojoy solving problems and developing solutions.
- I focus more on the backend area, which is strongly emphasized at 42Heilbronn.
- I am open to new technologies and concepts.
- I prefer developing my own algorithms, if time and context allow, rather than using existing ones.

In the long term, I can see myself becoming an expert in a specialized field.

Basicly: 
I am an open and direct person, who values both working independently ("Tunnel-Focus") and collaborating in a team, depending on the projectâ€™s needs. Fokus and Teamwork is key!
