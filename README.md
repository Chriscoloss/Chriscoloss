## "Hello World", I'm Christopher ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at 42Heilbronn with a focus on C and C++. I value clean, structured code that is easy to follow. Solving problems and developing solutions is something I enjoy, especially in the backend area, which is strongly emphasized at 42Heilbronn. I am always open to new technologies and concepts. Learning new things and incorporating my own ideas is particularly motivating for me â€“ I prefer developing my own algorithms, if time and context allow, rather than using existing ones. In the long term, I can see myself becoming an expert in a specialized field.

Basicly I am an open and direct person, who values both working independently ("Tunnel-Focus") and collaborating in a team, depending on the projectâ€™s needs. Fokus and Teamwork is key!
