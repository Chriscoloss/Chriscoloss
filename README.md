## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Chriscoloss/Chriscoloss** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 42Heilbronn Campus
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm left handed
